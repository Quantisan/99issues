When this\r\nquery is sent to the server, the server will respond with a\r\nResponse that has the corresponding SERVER_INFO ResponseType,\r\nand the same format as a SUCCESS_ATOM response. The official\r\ndrivers expose this as a function server() on the connection\r\nobject (so you write c = r.connect(...); c.server() to retrieve\r\nthe information).",
